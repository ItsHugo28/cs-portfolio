        <h1> How To Page: HTML Basics </h1>
        <h2> This is What I Made </h2>
        <div style="text-align:Center">
            <img src="photos/html2.gif" height="150px">
        </div>
        <div style="text-align:Center" class=text>
            I created an HTML website on basic instructions on how to use HTML. The projct overall works With Cloud9, HTML, and CSS. Cloud9 uses HTML and CSS to make websites. The codes I used for this instructional website is what I'm explaining. The choices I had
            to make is what font and sizes for font or tables I should use. While making this I learned how to correctly use tables and I know I'll remember this for future websites.
        </div>
        <h2> Starting Off </h2>
        <div style="text-align:Center" class="text">
            <img src="photos/!.png">
            <p> I created this to show how to start off. First when you create your file, name it what you want and put .html at the end of the title. I learned this because it makes it way easier to start of the code. So after press the file in your portfolio then press !+Tab in the first line, it creates the overview of the coding page.Then next, you have to enter the codes you'd like like text tags. You would do that by adding <>. If you put ! and press tab it will give
                you the outline of the HTML Page. Also in settings if you are using Cloud 9 go to experimental, and turn Auto-Save on, it should always auto save for you and you
                should be good to go. If you want you could change the document name with the &lt;title&gt; tag in the head of the page and just name it what you want. </p>
        </div>
        <h2> &lt;P&gt; Tag </h2>
        <div style="text-align:Center" class="text">
            <img src="photos/ptag.png">
            <p> I created this to show the basic way to type type. If you want to add text you have to put the p tag. I learned this so I am able to type like I am doing right now. This is the correct way to use a &lt;p&gt; tag. &lt;p&gt; tags stand for paragraphs
                so it is the basic way to type text. The middle of the area is where you insert text, you should have spaces between the front and back. It will make a paragraph.
            </p>
        </div>
        <h2> &lt;H1&gt; Tag </h2>
        <div style="text-align:Center" class="text">
            <img src="photos/htag.png">
            <p> I made this to show how to add headers. Headers are what make the website pop and gives your text a title. I made headers to describe what I will be talking about in the text. This is the correct what to use a &lt;h1&gt; tag. &lt;h1&gt stands
                for header 1 tag. There are 6 headers,&lt;h1&gt; through &lt;h6&gt;, the larger the number, the smaller the header size is. This will make a header. </p>
        </div>
        <h2> &lt;Img SRC=&quot;&quot;&gt; Tag </h2>
        <div style="text-align:Center" class="text">
            <img src="photos/imgtag.png">
            <p> I made this to show how to add images. I learned this because pictures makes the website look more nice. It adds visuals to help explain what you are making. I used images to show what I learned in these 2 weeks. This is the correct way to use
                a &lt;Img&gt; Tag. &lt;img src=&quot;&quot;&gt; tag stands for img source tag. You can put the link of the image between the quotations so that your picture can appear.</p>
        </div>
        <h2> &lt;Li&gt;,&lt;Ol&gt;,&lt;Ul&gt; Tags</h2>
        <div style="text-align:Center" class="text">
            <img src="photos/oltag.png">
            <img src="photos/ultag.png">
            <img src="photos/litag.png">
            <p> I'm showing this because list tages add list to your page. You can have list with bullitens, numbers, or nothing. I learned this to be able to list things like plans or ideas. This is the correct way to use &lt;Li&gt;,&lt;Ol&gt;,&lt;Ul&gt; Tags.
                &lt;Ol&gt; Tags stand for ordered list and are used for list that are ordered by number.&lt;Ul&gt; Tags stand for un-ordered list and are used for list that are listed but not ordered by number or bulliten. &lt;Li&gt; Tags stand for list and
                are used for regular bulliten list. For Ordered and Un-Ordered tags, you have to have both the &lt;li&gt; Tag and either &lt;ul&gt; or &lt;li&gt; Tag. </p>
        </div>
        <h2> &lt;Style&gt; tag </h2>
        <div style="text-align:Center" class="text">
            <img src="photos/stag.png">
            <p> I'm showing this because if you use style tags it gives your page color. It could also change sizes and fonts. I learned this make sure I can edit text and backgrounds to make things look a little more nice. StyleThis is the correct way to use
                &lt;style&gt; tag. &lt;Style&gt; tag stands for styling and is used for styling the page. You can change the background, font, color, etc with the style tag. This example would change the background color. You have to put the type of text
                you are changing. The body is the blank page, so you put body in front. h1 would be the header so you put h1 to change the header. You Would Use The Same &lt;Style&gt; Tag For Each Tag You Want To Change. </p>
        </div>
        <h2> Borders </h2>
        <div style="text-align:Center" class="text">
            <img src="photos/bordertag.png">
            <p> I learned how to make borders because it organizes your text. I have borders around so it looks more organized and a little nicer so it pops. I learned how to make borders because it makes organization easiers and formating easier. Withour borders
                text could be really unorgainzed and messing. This is the correct way to use borders with the &lt;style&gt; tag. You have to use a div and a class. Where I put "your text" is where you would put &lt;p&gt; tags,&lt;h&gt; tags, &lt;li&gt; tags,
                etc. Where I put "Name_Of_Class" , is where you would title your class, you could name it anything. Make sure you put a dot (.) in front to make it a class. Make sure you have Curly Brackets ({,}). I gave an example of what you could put inside
                the class. Whats inside the style tag is what your changing, where your going to put the text at is when you type &lt;div class=&quot;&quot;&gt;. </p>
