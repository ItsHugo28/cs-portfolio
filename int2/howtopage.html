  <h1> How To Page: JavaScript</h1>
  <h1> What I Made </h1>
  <h2> I used JavaScript and HTML to make art with coding. We used a tool called processing that helps us create the coding art. Coding could be used to make lots of things and ideas. In my class, we used many coding tools to make lots of types of arts.</h2>
  <h1> Circles </h1>
  <h2> <canvas id="cir"></canvas> <br> I created a generative art using computer code. The project overwall works with specifics codes that create shapes over and over. The specific codes I used was ellipses, fill, and strokes. The ellipse makes circles and you
    put the exact position and size you would like them in. The fill makes you put put the exact color you would like the circle or shape to be using RGB(Red, Green,Blue). The stroke code could adds a larger border around the shape. The choices I had
    to make is where exactly I want the shape to be or what size it should be. I also had to to decide on what color I wanted the shapes to be. I will always remember how to make shapes using code and how to customize them. Code consisty of ellipses which
    create circles by giving the x, y, width, and height inside parenthesis. Aftr you inputed the code it will display one circle, or more depending how many you put or where you put it in a function.</h2>
  <h1> Conditionals </h1>
  <h2> <canvas id="c"></canvas> <br> I created generative art that always creates blocks when your mouse moves in the square area. The project overall works with if else statements, which are conditional and shape codes. I used the code rect and mouseX, mouseY
    codes which is the main part of the code. mouseX and mouseY track your mouse creating more blocks. The rect code makes the rectangle in the code which is the shape. The choices I had to make are what shapes and colors I would use and also and also
    if I would show the continuous block being made. I will make sure I remember how to use if else statements and other conditional statements. Codintionals if else statements make you put if, or you could even have else to constantly test for an correct
    answer. This is what hackers use to figure out passwords. This is a very useful and powerful tool that helps coders a lot.</h2>
  <h1> Loops </h1>
  <h2> <canvas id="l"></canvas> <br> I created generative art that uses loops to make new patterns each time. The project overall works with loops and is a very useful code. Some specific codes I used was the code for which is a loop code that makes the objects
    constantly make patterns each time. The choices I had to make were what types of patterns I would make and how big the shapes would be. I learned how to make loops in coding and I'll try and make sure I remember that useful code. Loops use the code
    for and you input how many times you want to loop that code you are using which outcomes as a new art each time you refresh which is cool because it makes a new art each time.</h2>
  <h1> Functions </h1>
  <h2> <canvas id="f"></canvas> <br> I created generative art using functions and different shapes. The project overall works with functions that create the shape again where you click your mouse. The specific codes I used are functions, ellipses, lines, random,
    and mouseClicked. They all work together to create and random colors for the shapes in different locations. Some choices I had to make is what shape and objects would make for the functions. I will try to make sure I will remember functions because
    they are useful for constantly create objects in a different locations. Functions uses the the keyword "Functions" which could help creating things in new locations each time you press your mouse somewhere where is really cool.</h2>
